## Game Title: Duality

## Description:
Duality is a 2D platformer/side-scroller where players take on the role of a character who must solve puzzles in order to progress through different levels. Using the clone mechanic, the player can create a stationary clone of themselves to interact with platforms in order to unlock new doors and reveal new paths. The player must navigate through the environment by stepping on multiple pressure plates with both their characters and clone to progress.

As the player, you will control both the main character and their clone, and strategically place the clones in important locations to assist in solving the puzzles. The goal is to open doors and advance through each level by using the clone to stand on the platforms that require simultaneous activation.
