## Game Title: Duality

## Description:
Duality is a 2D platformer/side-scroller where players take on the role of a character who must solve puzzles in order to progress through different levels. Using the clone mechanic, the player can create a stationary clone of themselves to interact with platforms in order to unlock new doors and reveal new paths. The player must navigate through the environment by stepping on multiple pressure plates with both their characters and clone to progress.

As the player, you will control both the main character and their clone, and strategically place the clones in important locations to assist in solving the puzzles. The goal is to open doors and advance through each level by using the clone to stand on the platforms that require simultaneous activation.

## Genre:
Puzzle platformer and Action-Adventure

## Platform: 
PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X

## Developer:
NextGen Studios

## Desired Game Mechanic
We are developing a 2D platformer/side-scroller where the player must solve puzzles by stepping plates to unlock doors. The key mechanic is the ability to create a clone. The clone stays where the player places it and can interact with platforms, allowing the player and their clone to activate platforms simultaneously to progress through the level.

## Objective Statement
This prototype focuses on creating a 2D platformer that solves puzzles using the clone mechanic. By placing their clone on platforms, players will unlock doors and move forward in the level.

How does giving players control over a clone in a 2D platformer impact their ability to solve complex puzzles and interact with their environment?

## Design Rationale
We want the players to have freedom by creatively using their character and clone. Through this, the player will feel a sense of accomplishment when they solve the puzzles. We also want the players to ofeel challenged but rewarded. As the players solve more challenging puzzles, they will also feel a sense of accomplishment as they master the clone mechanic. We also want the player to feel as if the game was a collaborative effort between two players. Even though the player is in control of both the character and the clone, it will feel like a collaborative effort when it comes to problem-solving.

We feel as if the clone mechanic is innovative as it adds a new twist to the traditional platformer by making the players think about the timing and positioning of the clone. The whole premise of this mechanic doesn't just focus on the movement, but also on managing two entities to solve puzzles, which introduces a deeper layer of strategy to the gameplay.
